# 🌩️ Cloud Case Study: Scaling a FinTech Startup with AWS & DevOps Automation
Scaling a FinTech startup with AWS EKS, CI/CD, cost optimization, and DevSecOps.

---

##  Client Background
A fast-growing **FinTech startup** providing real-time payment analytics was struggling with scalability and reliability.  
Their platform had grown from **5K → 50K+ users in under 6 months**, and the monolithic architecture was reaching breaking point.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges
1. **Downtime & Performance Issues**  
   - Hosted on a single AWS EC2 instance.  
   - Frequent crashes during peak traffic (e.g., salary processing at month-end).  

2. **Manual Deployments**  
   - Code pushed manually via SSH.  
   - Slow, error-prone, no rollback process.  

3. **Rising Costs**  
   - Overprovisioned EC2s due to lack of autoscaling.  
   - No visibility into unused resources.  

4. **Security Gaps**  
   - Long-term IAM keys hardcoded in application code.  
   - No centralized monitoring for security events.

## ✅ CloudieHub Solution

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Modernization
- Migrated **monolith → microservices** running on **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)**  
- Introduced **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** for smart routing  
- Configured **Auto Scaling Groups** to handle demand spikes  

### 🔄 CI/CD Automation
- Set up **GitHub Actions** pipelines with:  
  - Automated builds & tests  
  - **Blue/Green deployments** for zero downtime  
  - Rollback-on-failure mechanism  

### 💰 Cost Optimization
- Shifted workloads to **EC2 Spot Instances** for non-critical services  
- Used **AWS Compute Optimizer** to right-size instances  
- Adopted **S3 Lifecycle Policies** → archived old logs, cutting storage costs by **40%**  

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- Eliminated long-term IAM keys → replaced with **STS temporary credentials**  
- Integrated **AWS GuardDuty** for continuous threat detection  
- Centralized logging with **CloudWatch + OpenSearch (ELK)** for visibility
